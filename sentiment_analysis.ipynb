I basically followed the recipe exactally except instead of adding the flour to the onions, I made a mix of flour, salt and pepper in a bag and then tossed the lamb to coat before browning. I added the spices to the onion/garlic to toast them slightly before deglazing with stock. Because I used the crockpot I cut the stock back to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup and used all the canned tomatoes. I added the canned chickpeas about an hour before serving.  This ended up cooking in the crockpot on low for about 6-7 hours. Served with Recipe #96875 this is a fabulous, filling family meal.

I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.

Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!   \n",

This is so good! I actually soaked the chicken in chicken bouillon first, and it made it super flavorful. I use Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce (DH's favorite), and cut chicken into nuggets instead of strips. This makes a good amount, so you could really freeze some and reheat in oven later. Those were our plans, but it was so good that it didn't make it to the ziploc bag!   \n",

       "16  We really enjoyed this and so did both my young daughters. For this recipe I decided my crockpot would be perfect. I basically followed the recipe exactally except instead of adding the flour to the onions, I made a mix of flour, salt and pepper in a bag and then tossed the lamb to coat before browning. I added the spices to the onion/garlic to toast them slightly before deglazing with stock. Because I used the crockpot I cut the stock back to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup and used all the canned tomatoes. I added the canned chickpeas about an hour before serving.  This ended up cooking in the crockpot on low for about 6-7 hours. Served with Recipe #96875 this is a fabulous, filling family meal.
